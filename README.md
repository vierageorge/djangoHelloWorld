# Django Hello World

Here I'll be adding the file used to learn the basics on Django.

## Prerequisites
Basically, have Python and Virtualenv installed on your PC with PATH correctly configured.

## Instructions
Create a virtual environment.
```
virtualenv django_venv
```
Activate the virtual environment
```
.\django_venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install Django in the virtual environment
```
pip install django
```
Create a project
```
django-admin startproject mysite
```
Verify if django project is working in development server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Deployment
TODO -> Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
